# YACV stands for Yet Another CV

With this fun project I wanted to explore many things. It's about a tv character I absolutely love 'Margo Hanson' from The Magicians.

This has been deployed on surge for the fun of it, you can find it here: https://yacv.surge.sh

# stack

I think I am now finished with my back to basics series. It's still html and css. 

# what i thought would happen

- thinking about the design
- choosing when to use flex and when to use grid, decide what is the best way to use them
- exploring sass a bit more

# what actually happened

- i had a lot of fun with the design though it's pretty simple
- i had trouble with keyframes and mixin but got it to work eventually

# what i learned from this project 

- mixin and sass mix very well
- partials scss files are great for reuse and useful 
- code compilation with a script, here "npm run sass"
- a keyframes bounce effect on the crown icon
